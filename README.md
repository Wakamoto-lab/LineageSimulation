# LineageSimulation

- This C code was used for the simulation in Fig. 4 and Fig. 4 - Figure supplement 1 in Yamauchi, et al. eLife 11:e72299 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72299e72299). 
- Gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.info/) is required to plot the simulation results. 
- Executing the compiled file ask you to select the simulation types. "1" is for the simulation without mother-daughter correlations of generation time (Fig. 4), and "2" is for the simulation with mother-daughter correlations (Fig. 4 - Figure supplement 1).
